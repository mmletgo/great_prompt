# Generate Wireframes

## Your Task
Generate detailed low-fidelity wireframes for each page/screen identified in the user flows.

## Prerequisites
Check that the following files exist:
- `designs/user-flows.md` - User flow diagrams
- `docs/front-end-spec.md` - UX design specifications (if available)

Check state:
- `design_phase.status` should be "user_flows_completed"

## Steps

### 1. Extract Pages from User Flows
Read `designs/user-flows.md` and identify all unique pages/screens.

Create a list of pages, for example:
- Login Page
- Dashboard
- User Profile
- Settings Page
- etc.

### 2. Create Wireframe Directory
Ensure `designs/wireframes/` directory exists.

### 3. Generate Wireframes for All Pages

**CRITICAL - BATCHED PARALLEL PROCESSING (NO SKIPPING)**:
- You MUST create WireframeDesigner subagents for EVERY SINGLE page from step 1
- Process in sub-batches of maximum 10 subagents at a time for manageability
- Count total pages FIRST, calculate number of sub-batches needed
- Process ALL sub-batches - DO NOT stop after first sub-batch
- Each sub-batch must complete before starting next sub-batch

**Batching Rules**:
1. Count total: `page_count = total unique pages from user-flows.md`
2. Calculate batches: `num_batches = ceil(page_count / 10)`
3. **MANDATORY PARALLEL EXECUTION WITHIN EACH SUB-BATCH**:
   - Within each sub-batch, you MUST create ALL subagents AT THE SAME TIME
   - DO NOT process sub-batch items one by one
   - DO NOT wait for one subagent to finish before starting the next
   - Create 10 `<subagent_task>` blocks simultaneously in one response
   - Example: For sub-batch of 10, output 10 subagent blocks together, not sequentially
4. Track progress: "Processing batch X of Y (10 pages)..."
5. Verify completion: After ALL batches, confirm total = page_count

**Example - 23 pages**:
```
Total pages: 23
Sub-batches needed: 3 (10 + 10 + 3)

Processing sub-batch 1 of 3 (10 pages)...
  Creating ALL 10 WireframeDesigner subagents SIMULTANEOUSLY:
  
  <subagent_task>Agent: @wireframe-designer (Login Page)</subagent_task>
  <subagent_task>Agent: @wireframe-designer (Signup Page)</subagent_task>
  <subagent_task>Agent: @wireframe-designer (Dashboard)</subagent_task>
  ... [ALL 10 subagent blocks in ONE response]
  
  ✓ Sub-batch 1 complete: 10/10 wireframes generated

Processing sub-batch 2 of 3 (10 pages)...
  Creating 10 WireframeDesigner subagents in parallel:
  - Profile → designs/wireframes/profile.md
  - Settings → designs/wireframes/settings.md
  ... (10 total)
  ✓ Sub-batch 2 complete: 10/10 wireframes generated

Processing sub-batch 3 of 3 (3 pages)...
  Creating 3 WireframeDesigner subagents in parallel:
  - Admin Panel → designs/wireframes/admin-panel.md
  - Reports → designs/wireframes/reports.md
  - Help → designs/wireframes/help.md
  ✓ Sub-batch 3 complete: 3/3 wireframes generated

✓ ALL batches complete: 23/23 wireframes generated (100% coverage)
```

**FORBIDDEN - PARTIAL BATCH PROCESSING**:
- ❌ "Processing first batch, skipping remaining pages"
- ❌ "Starting with batch 1, will continue later"
- ❌ "Core pages in batch 1, others optional"
- ❌ "Processing page 1... Processing page 2..." (串行执行)
- ❌ "Let me continue with page X" (one-by-one 处理)
- ✅ REQUIRED: "Creating ALL 10 subagents simultaneously in one response"
- ✅ REQUIRED: "ALL X batches processed" / "100% coverage across all batches"

**Verification Required**:
1. Count pages: `page_count = total unique pages from user-flows.md`
2. Calculate sub-batches: `num_batches = ceil(page_count / 10)`
3. For each sub-batch (1 to num_batches):
   - Output: "Processing sub-batch {i} of {num_batches} ({size} pages)..."
   - Create subagents: up to 10 per sub-batch
   - Confirm: "✓ Sub-batch {i} complete: {size}/{size} wireframes generated"
4. Final verification: "✓ ALL {num_batches} batches complete: {page_count}/{page_count} wireframes (100% coverage)"

**Important**: Process pages in sub-batches of 10 for parallel processing.

#### 3.1 Create WireframeDesigner Subagents in Sub-Batches

**CRITICAL - PARALLEL EXECUTION FORMAT**:
- For each sub-batch, create ALL subagent_task blocks in ONE response
- DO NOT create subagents one-by-one across multiple responses
- Output 10 `<subagent_task>` blocks together, then wait for all to complete

For the complete list of pages from step 1, process in sub-batches of up to 10 pages:

```
For each sub-batch of up to 10 pages (create ALL simultaneously):

<subagent_task>
Agent: @wireframe-designer
Input:
- Page name: [PageName]
- User flows: designs/user-flows.md
- UX spec: docs/front-end-spec.md
- Context: How this page appears in user flows

Task:
1. Identify page purpose and user goals
2. List all UI components needed
3. Define layout structure (header, nav, content, footer)
4. Specify interactive elements (buttons, forms, etc.)
5. Include states (loading, error, empty, success)
6. Add annotations for behavior and interactions
7. Use ASCII art or Mermaid for wireframe visualization
8. Consider responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Output format: Create designs/wireframes/[page-name].md with:
# [Page Name] - Wireframe

## Page Overview
[Purpose and context]

## User Goals
- Goal 1
- Goal 2

## Layout Structure
[ASCII art or Mermaid diagram showing layout]

## Components
### Component 1
- Type: [button/form/card/etc]
- Position: [location]
- Behavior: [interaction]
- States: [default/hover/active/disabled]

## Responsive Breakpoints
### Desktop (>1024px)
[Layout description]

### Tablet (768-1024px)
[Layout adjustments]

### Mobile (<768px)
[Mobile layout]

## Interaction Notes
- [Key interactions]
- [Transitions to other pages]
- [API calls triggered]

## Edge Cases
- Loading state
- Error state
- Empty state
- Success feedback
</subagent_task>
```

**Wait for current sub-batch to complete before proceeding to next sub-batch.**
**Wait for ALL sub-batches to complete before proceeding to step 4.**

### 4. Validate Wireframes Quality

After all wireframes are generated, perform comprehensive validation:

#### 5.1 Design Consistency Check
For each wireframe file, verify:

**Component Consistency**:
- [ ] All buttons follow the same naming convention (e.g., PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton)
- [ ] Form components use consistent field types (TextInput, SelectDropdown, etc.)
- [ ] Card/Container components have consistent structure
- [ ] Navigation elements match across pages
- [ ] Color/styling references match front-end-spec.md

**Layout Consistency**:
- [ ] Header/Navigation placement is consistent
- [ ] Footer placement is consistent
- [ ] Content area structure follows patterns
- [ ] Spacing/padding annotations are uniform

**State Coverage**:
- [ ] Each interactive component defines all states (default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error)
- [ ] Page-level states documented (loading, error, empty, success)
- [ ] Transition states specified (page-to-page navigation)

#### 5.2 Completeness Check
Verify each wireframe includes:
- [ ] Page Overview (purpose and context)
- [ ] User Goals section
- [ ] Layout Structure (ASCII art or Mermaid diagram)
- [ ] Components list with specifications
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
- [ ] Interaction notes
- [ ] Edge cases

#### 5.3 Cross-Reference Validation
- [ ] All pages mentioned in user-flows.md have wireframes
- [ ] All components referenced follow front-end-spec.md design system
- [ ] Navigation links match actual page files
- [ ] API interaction notes align with backend requirements (if specified)

#### 5.4 Naming Convention Check
- [ ] All file names use lowercase-with-hyphens.md format
- [ ] File names match page titles (normalized)
- [ ] No duplicate file names
- [ ] INDEX.md exists and is properly formatted

#### 5.5 Generate Validation Report
Create `designs/WIREFRAME_VALIDATION.md` with validation results.

**Report sections**:
- Summary: Total wireframes, passed, issues found
- Design Consistency: Component naming, layout, state coverage
- Completeness: Required sections present
- Cross-References: User flows coverage, design system compliance
- Issues to Fix: List of problems with file references
- Recommendations: Improvement suggestions
- Status: PASSED / NEEDS REVIEW / FAILED

#### 4.6 Address Validation Issues
If issues found:
1. List all issues clearly
2. Re-generate problematic wireframes with corrections
3. Re-run validation
4. Repeat until all issues resolved

### 5. Update State
Use Python script to mark wireframes as completed:

**📄 Script Reference**: See [.claude/scripts/README.md](../.claude/scripts/README.md)

**Python command**:
```python
from state_manager import StateManager

manager = StateManager()
manager.complete_wireframes(
    wireframes_count=8,  # Number of wireframes generated
    validation_status="passed",
    validation_report="designs/WIREFRAME_VALIDATION.md"
)
```

This updates state.json with:
- `design_phase.status = "completed"`
- `design_phase.wireframes_generated = true`
- All validation results and metadata

### 6. Generate Wireframes Index
Create `designs/WIREFRAMES_INDEX.md` listing all wireframe files.

**Index sections**:
- All Pages: Grouped by category with links to wireframe files
- Design System Reference: Link to front-end-spec.md
- User Flows Reference: Link to user-flows.md
- Validation Report: Link to WIREFRAME_VALIDATION.md

### 7. Output Summary

## Important Rules
- **Create ALL wireframe subagents at once for maximum parallelization**
- Subagents process pages in parallel (no sequential processing)
- Each wireframe must be in a separate file in `designs/wireframes/`
- Use consistent naming: lowercase-with-hyphens.md
- **Index and validation files go in `designs/` (not `designs/wireframes/`)**
- Always create WIREFRAMES_INDEX.md and WIREFRAME_VALIDATION.md after completion
- **Always run validation after generation**
- Include all UI states (loading, error, empty, success)
- Fix validation issues before marking phase complete
- All components must reference design system from front-end-spec.md
- Component names must be consistent across all wireframes
