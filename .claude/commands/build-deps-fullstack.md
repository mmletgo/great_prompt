# Build Fullstack Dependency Graph

## Your Task
Analyze all frontend and backend tasks and build a comprehensive dependency graph.

## Prerequisites
Check that both frontend and backend decomposition are complete:
- `decomposition_phase.frontend_status == "completed"`
- `decomposition_phase.backend_status == "completed"`
- All frontend tasks are at component level (type == "component")
- All backend tasks are at function level (type == "function")

## Steps

### 1. Collect All Tasks (All Levels)
From task_registry.json (tree structure):
- **Level 3 tasks**: Leaf nodes (components/functions) - Direct implementation
- **Level 2 tasks**: Integration tasks (pages/services) - Assemble Level 3 children
- **Level 1 tasks**: Root tasks (modules) - Assemble Level 2 children

**Python example**:
```python
task_mgr = TaskRegistryManager()

# Get all Level 3 tasks (leaf tasks - direct implementation)
frontend_components = task_mgr.get_tasks_by_level(3, category="frontend")
backend_functions = task_mgr.get_tasks_by_level(3, category="backend")

# Get all Level 2 tasks (integration tasks - assemble children)
frontend_pages = task_mgr.get_tasks_by_level(2, category="frontend")
backend_services = task_mgr.get_tasks_by_level(2, category="backend")

# Get all Level 1 tasks (root tasks - final assembly)
frontend_modules = task_mgr.get_tasks_by_level(1, category="frontend")
backend_modules = task_mgr.get_tasks_by_level(1, category="backend")

print(f"Level 3: {len(frontend_components)} components + {len(backend_functions)} functions")
print(f"Level 2: {len(frontend_pages)} pages + {len(backend_services)} services")
print(f"Level 1: {len(frontend_modules)} + {len(backend_modules)} modules")
print(f"Total tasks: {len(frontend_components) + len(backend_functions) + len(frontend_pages) + len(backend_services) + len(frontend_modules) + len(backend_modules)}")
```

### 2. Invoke Fullstack Dependency Analyzer
```
Create a FullstackDependencyAnalyzer subagent.

<subagent_task>
Agent: @fullstack-dependency-analyzer
Input:
- Frontend tasks: from task_registry
- Backend tasks: from task_registry
- Context files: .claude_tasks/contexts/

Task:
1. Analyze Frontend Dependencies:
   - Component hierarchy (parent/child)
   - Shared components used by multiple pages
   - State management dependencies
   - API calls to backend

2. Analyze Backend Dependencies:
   - Service layer dependencies
   - Data access dependencies
   - Utility function dependencies
   - Authentication middleware dependencies

3. Analyze Frontend-Backend Dependencies:
   - Match frontend API calls to backend endpoints
   - Identify backend functions required by frontend

4. Build Cross-Stack Dependency Graph:
   
   **Horizontal Dependencies (same level)**:
   - Backend functions must complete before frontend components that use them
   - Shared components must complete before page components
   - Authentication backend must complete before protected frontend pages
   - **Use dot notation IDs** for all dependencies (e.g., "1.1.2" depends on "2.1.3")
   
   **Vertical Dependencies (bottom-up integration)**:
   - **Level 2 depends on Level 3**: Pages/Services depend on ALL their child components/functions
     * Frontend: Page "1.1" depends on children ["1.1.1", "1.1.2", "1.1.3"]
     * Backend: Service "2.1" depends on children ["2.1.1", "2.1.2", "2.1.3"]
   - **Level 1 depends on Level 2**: Modules depend on ALL their child pages/services
     * Frontend: Module "1" depends on children ["1.1", "1.2", "1.3"]
     * Backend: Module "2" depends on children ["2.1", "2.2", "2.3"]
   - Integration tasks (Level 1 & 2) assemble their completed children into cohesive units

5. Create Execution Waves with Balanced Task Distribution:
   
   **ðŸ“„ Complete Algorithm Documentation**: [Wave Balancing Algorithm](../WAVE_BALANCING_ALGORITHM.md)
   
   **Wave Balancing Strategy**:
   - Target: 5-10 tasks per wave (optimal for parallel processing)
   - Use topological sort to respect dependencies
   - Group tasks at same dependency level into same wave
   - Split large groups across multiple waves to maintain 5-10 task limit
   - Prefer keeping related tasks together when possible
   
   **Wave Assignment Algorithm**:
   1. Topological sort all tasks by dependencies
   2. Group tasks by dependency level (tasks with no unmet dependencies = level 0)
   3. For each level:
      - If level has â‰¤10 tasks: Create one wave
      - If level has >10 tasks: Split into multiple waves of 5-10 tasks each
      - Keep backend/frontend of same feature together when splitting
   4. Assign wave numbers sequentially
   
   **Example Wave Distribution**:
   - Total tasks: 47 (20 backend, 27 frontend)
   - Level 0 (no deps): 12 tasks â†’ Wave 1 (8 tasks), Wave 2 (4 tasks)
   - Level 1 (depends on level 0): 18 tasks â†’ Wave 3 (9 tasks), Wave 4 (9 tasks)
   - Level 2 (depends on level 1): 17 tasks â†’ Wave 5 (8 tasks), Wave 6 (9 tasks)
   - Result: 6 waves, each with 4-9 tasks

**CRITICAL - Save output to file, do NOT return large JSON**:

Output format: Save to `.claude_tasks/dependency_graph.json`

```json
{
  "frontend_dependencies": {...},
  "backend_dependencies": {...},
  "cross_stack_dependencies": {
    "1.2.3": ["2.1.1", "2.1.2"],  // Frontend component depends on backend functions
    "1.1": ["1.1.1", "1.1.2", "1.1.3"],  // Level 2 page depends on Level 3 components
    "1": ["1.1", "1.2", "1.3"]  // Level 1 module depends on Level 2 pages
  },
  "execution_order": [
    // Phase 1: Level 3 Implementation (leaf nodes)
    {
      "wave": 1,
      "level": 3,
      "category": "backend",
      "tasks": ["2.1.1", "2.1.2", "2.2.1"],
      "description": "Backend utility functions"
    },
    {
      "wave": 2,
      "level": 3,
      "category": "backend",
      "tasks": ["2.3.1", "2.3.2"],
      "description": "Backend API endpoints"
    },
    {
      "wave": 3,
      "level": 3,
      "category": "frontend",
      "tasks": ["1.1.1", "1.1.2", "1.1.3"],
      "description": "Frontend components"
    },
    
    // Phase 2: Level 2 Integration (assemble children)
    {
      "wave": 4,
      "level": 2,
      "category": "backend",
      "tasks": ["2.1", "2.2"],
      "description": "Backend service integration",
      "children": {
        "2.1": ["2.1.1", "2.1.2"],
        "2.2": ["2.2.1"]
      }
    },
    {
      "wave": 5,
      "level": 2,
      "category": "frontend",
      "tasks": ["1.1", "1.2"],
      "description": "Frontend page integration",
      "children": {
        "1.1": ["1.1.1", "1.1.2", "1.1.3"],
        "1.2": ["1.2.1", "1.2.2"]
      }
    },
    
    // Phase 3: Level 1 Integration (final assembly)
    {
      "wave": 6,
      "level": 1,
      "category": "backend",
      "tasks": ["2"],
      "description": "Backend module integration",
      "children": {
        "2": ["2.1", "2.2", "2.3"]
      }
    },
    {
      "wave": 7,
      "level": 1,
      "category": "frontend",
      "tasks": ["1"],
      "description": "Frontend module integration",
      "children": {
        "1": ["1.1", "1.2", "1.3"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**After saving file, output**: "âœ“ Saved dependency graph to .claude_tasks/dependency_graph.json"
</subagent_task>
```

### 3. Update Task Registry with Dependency Graph

**CRITICAL - Call the pre-built script to update registry**:

After the analyzer subagent completes and saves the dependency graph JSON file, run:

```bash
cd .claude/scripts
python update_dependency_graph.py --input ../.claude_tasks/dependency_graph.json
```

**What the script does automatically**:
1. **Loads dependency graph** from analyzer output JSON file
2. **Validates the graph**:
   - Checks all required fields present
   - Verifies wave numbers are sequential
   - Confirms task counts (5-10 per wave)
   - Validates all tasks are included
   - Checks no circular dependencies
3. **Adds dependencies** to task_registry.json:
   - Cross-stack dependencies (frontend â†’ backend)
   - Internal dependencies (within frontend/backend)
   - Uses dot notation IDs (e.g., "1.2.3" depends on "2.1.1")
4. **Sets execution order**:
   - Updates task_registry.json with waves
   - Includes level, category, description for each wave
5. **Updates state.json**:
   - Sets dependency_phase.status = "completed"
   - Sets dependency_phase.total_waves
6. **Prints summary** of execution plan

**Expected output**:
```
Loading dependency graph from dependency_graph.json...

Validating dependency graph...
âœ“ Dependency graph validation passed

Adding dependencies to task registry...
âœ“ Added 47 dependencies

Setting execution order (waves)...
âœ“ Set execution order with 9 waves

âœ… Dependency graph successfully updated!
   - task_registry.json: dependencies and execution order added
   - state.json: dependency_phase marked complete

```

### 4. Validate
Ensure:
- No circular dependencies
- Backend endpoints complete before frontend components that call them
- Shared components complete before dependent components
- All tasks included in execution order
- **Each wave has 5-10 tasks** (except possibly last wave)
- Tasks within wave have no mutual dependencies

### 5. Output Summary

  - 2.1.1 (POST /api/auth/login)
  - 2.1.2 (validate_credentials)

âœ“ Ready for parallel development

Next command: /parallel-dev-fullstack [N]
```

## Important Rules
- Backend APIs must complete before frontend components that use them
- Authentication/authorization backends have highest priority
- Shared frontend components before specific page components
- Database layer before service layer
- Service layer before API endpoints

## Wave Balancing Rules

### Target: 5-10 Tasks Per Wave

**Why 5-10 tasks?**
- Minimum 5: Enough parallelism to utilize worker pool efficiently
- Maximum 10: Manageable batch size, faster feedback cycles
- Balanced workload: Prevents bottlenecks and idle workers

**Balancing Algorithm**:

1. **Topological Sort**: Order all tasks by dependencies
   ```
   Level 0: No dependencies (can start immediately)
   Level 1: Depends only on Level 0
   Level 2: Depends on Level 0 or Level 1
   ...
   ```

2. **Group by Dependency Level**: Tasks at same level can execute in parallel
   ```
   Level 0: [task_001, task_002, ..., task_012]  (12 tasks)
   Level 1: [task_013, task_014, ..., task_030]  (18 tasks)
   Level 2: [task_031, task_032, ..., task_047]  (17 tasks)
   ```

3. **Split Large Groups**: If level has >10 tasks, split into multiple waves
   ```
   Level 0 (12 tasks) â†’ Wave 1 (8 tasks), Wave 2 (4 tasks)
   Level 1 (18 tasks) â†’ Wave 3 (9 tasks), Wave 4 (9 tasks)
   Level 2 (17 tasks) â†’ Wave 5 (8 tasks), Wave 6 (9 tasks)
   ```

4. **Feature Affinity**: When splitting, keep related tasks together
   ```
   Level 1 Auth tasks (9 tasks) â†’ Wave 3
   Level 1 Profile tasks (9 tasks) â†’ Wave 4
   ```

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "execution_order": [
    {
      "wave": 1,
      "category": "backend",
      "tasks": ["BE_util_001", "BE_util_002", "BE_validator_001", ...],
      "task_count": 8,
      "description": "Backend utilities and validators"
    },
    {
      "wave": 2,
      "category": "backend",
      "tasks": ["BE_repo_001", "BE_repo_002", ...],
      "task_count": 6,
      "description": "Backend repositories"
    },
    {
      "wave": 3,
      "category": "backend",
      "tasks": ["BE_api_auth_001", "BE_api_auth_002", ...],
      "task_count": 9,
      "description": "Auth API endpoints"
    },
    {
      "wave": 4,
      "category": "mixed",
      "tasks": ["BE_api_profile_001", ..., "FE_shared_001", ...],
      "task_count": 7,
      "description": "Profile APIs + Shared components"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Validation Checks**:
- âœ“ Each wave has 5-10 tasks (except last wave may have <5)
- âœ“ No task depends on another task in same wave
- âœ“ All dependencies satisfied by previous waves
- âœ“ Total tasks = sum of all wave tasks
